## What I Can Explain in My Own Words
Alert Management platforms are used to track any incoming alerts and are used to deal with said alerts eg. Splunk and Elastic
The role of an L1 analyst is to review alerts, distinguish between legitimate and malicious ones, and notify L2 analysts in the event of a real threat.
Examples of alert properties are the severity, alert and event time, the name of the alert, status and assignee.
Alert prioritisation involves filtering the alerts from those that are assigned, sort by severity and the alert time
