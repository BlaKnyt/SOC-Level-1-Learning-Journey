## Time Spent
Approximately 2–3 hours across multiple study sessions

## Progress
- Focused on alert triaging and reporting within the SOC Level 1 learning path
- Reviewed how alerts are assessed, prioritised, and documented by a Tier 1 SOC analyst
- Practised analysing alert information before determining next actions

## Key Concepts Learned
- The purpose of alert triaging in a SOC environment
- How analysts determine alert priority based on severity, context, and potential impact
- How to structure alert reports using the 5Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why)
- The importance of clarity and consistency when documenting alerts

## Application
Applied triaging concepts by reviewing example alerts and identifying key details required for investigation. Practised breaking down alerts
into the 5Ws to ensure reports clearly communicate what occurred, where it occurred, and why it was flagged. Focused on documenting findings
in a way that supports effective escalation and handover.

## Challenges
- Developing confidence in deciding whether an alert requires escalation or additional investigation
- Ensuring reports include sufficient context without making assumptions

## Next Steps
- Continue progressing through the SOC Level 1 learning path
- Practise writing full alert reports using TryHackMe labs
- Build consistency in applying the triage process across different alert types
