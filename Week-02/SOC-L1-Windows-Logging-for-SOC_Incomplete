## Time Spent
90 minutes focused on study and practical review of Security Log: User Management & Sysmon: Process Monitoring

## Progress
- Completed two additional tasks out of a total of eight (currently 5/8)
- User management and process monitoring on Windows

## Key Concepts Learned
- Different log event IDs related to user management
- Structure of user management events (subject, object and details of an event)
- Hunting for backdoored users using the event viewer
- What is Sysmon and the basic usage of Sysmon
- Process creation event code in Sysmon vs Security Log
- The process of hunting for Backdoored users

## Application
I applied the analysis of a SYSmon event log and Security log in the virtual machine on TryHackMe where I had to analyse
saved logs to search for a possible backdoored user with the event ID 4720//4732 and I analysed a process launch with the
event ID 1. The aim of the exercise was to learn how to analyse logs and search for any suspicious activity logged by the
event log and Sysmon.

## Next Steps
- Finish the remaining three tasks
- Find more virtual machines to practice
