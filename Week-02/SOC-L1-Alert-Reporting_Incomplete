## Time Spent
120 minutes focused on study and practical review of SOC reporting

## Progress
- Completed 75% of “SOC L1 Alert Reporting” section
- Reviewed SOC Alert Funnel, Reporting Guide and Escalation procedures used in a Tier 1 environment

## Key Concepts Learned
- The structure of an alert report using the 5Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why)
- Standard escalation workflows followed by a SOC team
- How to determine the appropriate escalation point based on alert severity
- How alerts are documented and communicated using a SIEM platform such as Splunk

## Application
Applied alert reporting concepts by analysing example authentication-related alerts and mapping observed activity to the 5Ws reporting framework. Practised identifying when activity should be escalated based on behaviour, context, and potential risk.

## Next Steps
- Finish remaining activity, SOC Communication
- Practise writing a full alert report using the 5Ws framework based on a simulated SIEM alert
